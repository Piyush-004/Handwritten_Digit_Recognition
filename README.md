Handwritten digit recognition is the process to provide the ability to machines to recognize human handwritten digits. I developed an automated handwritten digit recognition model which helps in recognizing handwritten digits used in zip codes on mail envelopes, amounts written on bank cheques using neural networks. The project is implemented using Python, leveraging powerful libraries like TensorFlow for machine learning, NumPy for mathematical computations and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Dataset used - MNIST dataset
